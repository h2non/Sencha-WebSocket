# Sencha WebSocket 
 
Sencha WebSocket is a WebSocket library for Sencha JavaScript frameworks.

It provides a lot of functionalities, extensible event-handling, full integration with Sencha core framework, abstraction from JavaScript native API and more...

## What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a web technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection. 
WebSocket is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. 
The WebSocket protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade request.
The WebSocket protocol makes possible more interaction between a browser and a web site, facilitating live content and the creation of real-time applications.
